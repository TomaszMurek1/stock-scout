Goal: Generate a visually stunning and highly functional "Equity Investment Analysis Dashboard" based on the provided table data, emphasizing long-term growth potential and risk elimination, according to the methodology outlined in the source documents. The dashboard must be designed for professional investors seeking results better than the benchmark (S&P 500)

Dashboard Structure and Visualization Instructions
The dashboard must be highly responsive, modern (dark mode recommended for a "world-class" look), and organized into three primary sections, clearly labelled, with dedicated sections for Indicator Explanations.
A. Global Functionality and Aesthetics
1. Visual Style: Use a modern, clean design (e.g., muted dark background, vibrant accent colors for metrics).
2. Explanations (Crucial): Every single displayed indicator (KPI or chart element) must have an accompanying tooltip or side panel that provides a clear, concise definition of the indicator, what it measures, and the recommended threshold values according to the methodology (e.g., ROIC > 15%).
3. Color Coding: Use green for metrics meeting or exceeding positive thresholds/forecasts (e.g., Revenue CAGR > 5%), red for metrics falling below critical safety thresholds (e.g., Current Ratio < 1), and amber/yellow for metrics that are acceptable but not stellar.
4. Filtering/Selection: If analyzing multiple tickers, include a prominent filter allowing the user to select the analyzed company.
B. Section 1: Zyskowność i Wzrost (Profitability and Growth)
This section must dominate the dashboard space as Growth is the critical factor driving long-term returns.
1. Long-Term Performance Comparison Chart:
    ◦ Type: Multi-line trend chart spanning 10 years (or maximum available history).
    ◦ Data Series: Display the stock price total return (10Y_Total_Return) compared against the growth of key financial metrics: 10Y_Revenue_Growth, 10Y_NetIncome_Growth, and 10Y_CFO_Growth.
    ◦ Insight: Visually demonstrate the core principle that stock price movements correlate with the growth of profits, revenues, and cash flow in the long term.
2. Key Profitability Indicators (KPI Cards): Display the current values for:
    ◦ ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): Goal: Minimum 15%. Color code based on achieving this threshold.
    ◦ ROA (Return on Assets): Goal: Minimum 15%. Color code based on achieving this threshold.
    ◦ Operating Margin: Goal: Stable, minimum 20%. Use color to indicate stability and level.
3. Future Growth Dynamics (Forecasts): Present these as prominent indicators, stressing that future dynamism is the key to investment success.
    ◦ Revenue CAGR (2Y Forecast): Display Revenue_CAGR_2Y_Forecast. Highlight the threshold: Min 5%.
    ◦ EPS Growth (5Y Forecast): Display EPS_CAGR_5Y_Forecast. Highlight the goal: Growing at least 2x the Revenue growth rate.
    ◦ CFO Growth Rate Forecast: Display CFO_Growth_Rate_Forecast. Highlight the threshold: Min 10%.
    ◦ Forecast Revision Direction: Use a highly visible indicator (e.g., an arrow icon and text) displaying Forecast_Revision_Direction. Revisions 'Up' are a very strong positive signal.
C. Section 2: Filtry Bezpieczeństwa (Fundamental Safety Filters)
This section is designed to eliminate high-risk companies, not to select the best ones. Use status indicators, gauges, or heatmaps to quickly confirm compliance with minimal safety standards.
1. Liquidity and Debt Ratios (Status Gauges): Create gauges for the following mandatory filters, clearly marking the acceptable thresholds:
    ◦ Current Ratio: Value display of Current_Ratio. Filter Threshold: Must be > 1.0. If < 1.0, flag as a critical warning (RED).
    ◦ Debt to Assets: Value display of Debt_to_Assets. Max Acceptance: 40% (0.40). If significantly above 40%, flag as highly indebted (RED/AMBER).
    ◦ Interest Coverage: Value display of Interest_Coverage. Filter Threshold: Must be > 3.0.
    ◦ CFO to Total Debt: Value display of CFO_to_Total_Debt. Filter Threshold: Must be > 0.3.
2. Risk Summary:
    ◦ Olson Indicator: Display Olson_Indicator value. Filter Threshold: Must be < 2% risk of bankruptcy.
    ◦ Debt Trend: Display Debt_Trend. Reward/Premiums: Flag companies with a 'Decreasing' debt trend as safer.
D. Section 3: Kontekst Wyceny i Timing (Valuation and Timing)
Valuation is secondary, used primarily for contextual timing and risk management (to avoid buying a bubble).
1. Upside Potential (Key Timing Indicator):
    ◦ KPI and Gauge: Display the current Upside percentage. Use a gauge chart to show the Upside relative to its historical range (if possible, based on historical Upside data not explicitly provided but implied by the methodology).
    ◦ Interpretation Tip (Tooltip): Clearly explain that a low Upside (near zero) suggests the stock has reached the 12-month analyst target and may signal a need to wait for a correction/pullback.
2. Historical Relative Valuation:
    ◦ P/S Trend Chart (5 Years): Display the current P_S value plotted against its P_S_Median_5Y and P_S_High_5Y.
    ◦ Visual Interpretation: Mark the areas of the chart: "Expensive" (near P/S High), "Fairly Valued" (near Median), and "Historically Cheap" (low P/S).
    ◦ Growth Stock Caveat (Crucial Tooltip): Include a prominent note or dynamic text explaining that for high-growth companies (those meeting the Section 1 criteria), a historically high P/S may still be cheap if the denominator (Sales/Revenue) is expected to grow significantly next year (i.e., forward P/S is lower than current P/S). The best companies are often not cheap.
Summary of Indicators and Explanations
The resulting dashboard must coherently integrate these three sections. For the user's benefit, ensure the indicator explanations clearly communicate the long-term methodology: focus on Growth (especially future forecasts), use Fundamentals only to exclude potential bankruptcies, and treat Valuation (especially low P/E/P/S) with skepticism, prioritizing the Upside metric for timing context


Note that I already have some dashboard which you can extend (you can regroup, reorganize, add indicators but cannot remove whats already there, use table we just created and filled with data - CompanyFinancialHistory )
